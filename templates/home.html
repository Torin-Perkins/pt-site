                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>For years, I've struggled with obesity, eating disorders, and body dysmorphia. Finding a passion for fitness has allowed me to work through these issues and continue to learn. In every aspect of my personal and professional life, a commitment to health and fitness has allowed me to be the best I can be. I've spent years pushing myself to higher levels, learning what it takes to grow both physically and mentally. 

I want to share this passion with others, helping them find the same strength and success within themselves. 

Becoming an ISSA-certified trainer was the next step in my journey, giving me the tools to take what I’ve learned and apply it to the unique needs of each client I work with.

When you train with me, you’re not just getting a coach — you’re getting someone who understands the grind, celebrates the victories, and pushes you to break past limits you didn’t think possible.</p>

                <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
                <p>I believe in a holistic approach to health and fitness. My training methodology focuses on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Evidence-Based Training:</strong> Programs backed by science and proven results</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Nutrition:</strong> No crash diets, just real food, lasting habits, and results</li>
                    <li><strong>Individual Approach:</strong> Every body and mind is different, your plan should be too</li>
                    <li><strong>Accountability & Support:</strong> My clients are my friends and I will always support my friends</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Whether you're looking to lose weight, build muscle, improve athletic performance, or simply live a healthier lifestyle, I'm here to guide you.</p>
