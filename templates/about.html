                <p class="journey-intro">
                    My fitness journey wasn't always a success story. Like many people, I had to overcome significant obstacles—both physical and mental—to become the person I am today.
                </p>

                <div class="journey-story">
                    <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my adolescent life, I struggled with commitment to any sort of physical activity. I grew into a depressive state during the COVID-19 lockdown and lost what little discipline I had; I gained 70 lbs and was disgusted with myself. This deep loathing festered into an eating disorder that had me consuming less than 500 calories a day. Yes, I lost weight, but I also passed out in the gym. As soon as I was tempted with food, I swung the other direction and gained all the weight back. My confidence was at an all-time low—I felt awful, and couldn't have felt worse about myself.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Transformation</h3>
                    <p>
                        A switch flipped when I met my training partner. He gave me the push I needed to actually make the change I already wanted to make. Through ups and downs, he pushed me and, reciprocally, I pushed him. We learned about training together and devoted ourselves to our craft. Over 4 years, I was able to develop a physique I am proud of and compete in bodybuilding. But more importantly, I learned that transformation isn't a solo journey—it's exponentially easier with someone in your corner who believes in you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Philosophy Today</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every single person deserves to feel confident, healthy, and strong. The foundation of this starts with physical fitness and discipline. Sticking to new habits isn't easy, but with a friend by your side, it becomes a whole lot easier. I am a friend first and a coach second. This isn't just about lifting weights or counting macros—it's about building lasting habits, developing mental resilience, and creating a lifestyle you can sustain. I believe in education over instruction; I want my clients to understand not just what they're doing, but why they're doing it, so they can own their transformation.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why I Coach</h3>
                    <p>
                        I coach because I know what it's like to be at your lowest point, and I know what it takes to climb back up. Seeing my clients transform—not just physically, but mentally and emotionally—is the most rewarding experience of my life. I don't just want to help you reach your goals; I want to help you become the best version of yourself. My passion is helping people realize their potential and proving to themselves what they're truly capable of. When you succeed, I succeed. We're in this together, and I'm committed to being your biggest advocate every step of the way.
